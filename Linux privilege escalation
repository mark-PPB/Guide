(Linux) privilege escalation is all about:

Collect - Enumeration, more enumeration and some more enumeration.
Process - Sort through data, analyse and prioritisation.
Search - Know what to search for and where to find the exploit code.
Adapt - Customize the exploit, so it fits. Not every exploit work for every system "out of the box".
Try - Get ready for (lots of) trial and error.
